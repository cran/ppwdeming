Description: Weighted Deming regression, also known as 'errors-in-variable' 
    regression, is applied with suitable weights. Weights are modeled via a 
    precision profile; thus the methods implemented here are referred to as  
    precision profile weighted Deming (PWD) regression. The package covers 
    two settings – one where the precision profiles are known either from
    external studies or from adequate replication of the X and Y readings, 
    and one in which there is a plausible functional form for the precision 
    profiles but the exact (unknown) function must be estimated from the 
    (generally singlicate) readings.
    The function set includes tools for: estimated standard errors (via 
    jackknifing); standardized-residual analysis function with regression 
    diagnostic tools for normality, linearity and constant variance; and an 
    outlier analysis identifying significant outliers for closer investigation. 
    The following reference provides further information on mathematical 
    derivations and applications.
